  This is a major update, the default SCCAN output has changed:
  - SCCAN weights now show relationship with behavior
  - SCCAN weights can now range -1 to 1
  - added 'directionalSCCAN' argument for back compatbility
  - default sparseness range is now -0.9 to 0.9
  - removed pval.img output from SCCAN output
  - removed rawStat argument from SCCAN
  - raw SCCAN weights always returned in rawWeights.img output
  - new outputs returned from SCCAN: eig2 and ccasummary
  - removed sccan.BehaviorWeight output, info now in eig2 output
  - added sparseness.behav argument to lsm_sccan
  - changed names for lowerSparseness, upperSparseness, nFolds, etc.
  - overall info display improvements
  - increased 'cvRepetitions' automatically for small samples
  - lesymap screen output now captured in printedOutput variable
  - save.lesymap() now saving printed output
  - changed warnings to cat for proper output capture
