Description: LESYMAP maps the specific brain areas responsible for
    cognitive deficits by taking a series of lesion maps and a vector
    of behavioral scores. Both univariate (t-test, Brunner-Munzel,
    regression) and multivariate (sparse canonical corelations) tests are
    available. LESYMAP is built to run both real and simulated
    lesion-to-symptom mapping analyses.
